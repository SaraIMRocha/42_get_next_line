LEAKS

A memory leak in C happens when a computer program 
poorly handles memory allocations and fails to free up the memory that 
is no longer required. Memory leaks can have an effect on lowering 
the system's performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based
on manipulating files for data management and persistence.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GET_NEXT_LINE
-------------
DESCRIPTION
This function takes an opened file descriptor and returns its next line.
This function has undefined behavior when reading from a binary file.
PARAMETERS
#1. A file descriptor 
RETURN VALUES
If successful, get_next_line returns a string with the full line ending in
a line break (`\n`) when there is one. 
If an error occurs, or there's nothing more to read, it returns NULL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
-------------------
READ_TO_LEFT_STR
-----------------
DESCRIPTION
Takes the opened file descriptor and saves on a "buff" variable what readed
from it. Then joins it to the cumulative static variable for the persistence
of the information.
PARAMETERS
#1. A file descriptor.
#2. The pointer to the cumulative static variable from previous runs of
get_next_line.
RETURN VALUES
The new static variable value with buffer joined for the persistence of the info,
or NULL if error.

a funcao read tenta ler nbytes de um ficheiro que esta associado a
descricao depois do open (estara no main)

o BUFFER_SIZE esta definido no header. quando e testado,
o size e alteravel. neste caso usamos o termo BUFFER_SIZE
previamente definido para que a variavel possa ser modificada
ex: o meu buffer esta definido para 50, quando digo BUFFER_SIZE + 1
(para ter espaco para o null) estou na verdade a dizer 50 + 1

When memory blocks are allotted by calloc(), malloc(), or realloc()  
functions, the C library function free() is used to deallocate or release
 the memory blocks to reduce their wastage. 
free() function in C should only be used either for the pointers pointing 
to the memory allocated using malloc() or for a NULL pointer. free() 
function only frees the memory from the heap and it does not call the 
destructor. To destroy the allocated memory and call the destructor 
we can use the delete() operator in C.

File descriptor is a reference that points to a file that is opened on
your computer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNOPSIS

       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION

       read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd
       into the buffer starting at buf.

       On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at
       the file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number
       of bytes read.  If the file offset is at or past the end of file,
       no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.

       If count is zero, read() may detect the errors described below.
       In the absence of any errors, or if read() does not check for
       errors, a read() with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other
       effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The open() function establishes the connection between a file and a 
file descriptor. It creates an open file description that refers to a file 
and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file 
descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file. The path 
argument points to a pathname naming the file.

The open() function will return a file descriptor for the named file 
that is the lowest file descriptor not currently open for that process.
 The open file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor does 
 not share it with any other process in the system. The FD_CLOEXEC file 
 descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor will be cleared.

The file offset used to mark the current position within the file 
is set to the beginning of the file.
The file status flags and file access modes of the open file 
description will be set according to the value of oflag.

Values for oflag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive-OR of 
flags from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>. 
Applications must specify exactly one of the first three values 
(file access modes) below in the value of oflag:

O_RDONLY
    Open for reading only. 
O_WRONLY
    Open for writing only. 
O_RDWR
    Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined 
	if this flag is applied to a FIFO. 

A FIFO file is a special kind of file on the local storage which 
allows two or more processes to communicate with each other by 
reading/writing to/from this file. A FIFO special file is entered 
into the filesystem by calling mkfifo() in C.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Static variables are initialized only once. The compiler persists with 
the variable till the end of the program. Static variables can be defined
 inside or outside the function. They are local to the block. 
 The default value of static variables is zero. The static variables 
 are alive till the execution of the program.

Actual code
utils: ft_strlen
queremos que os limites sejam paragrafos (new line)
em vez de null, entao trocamos o '\0' por '\n'
